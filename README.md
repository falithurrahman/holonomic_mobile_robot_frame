#### Description
In this project i designed a platform for holonomic mobile robot with 4 omni-wheels. These wheels are moved by dc motor coupled with planetary gear mechanism. I designed this platform using Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor. I used 3mm and 5 mm allumunium alloy as a material for this robot platform. Then i have these alloys cut with laser cutting machine.
