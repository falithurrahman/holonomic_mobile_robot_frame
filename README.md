#### Description
In this project i designed a platform for holonomic mobile robot with 4 omni-wheels. I designed this platform using Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor. I used 3mm and 5 mm allumunium alloy as a material for this robot platform. Then i have these alloys cut with laser cutting machine. I divided the explanation for these platform into several parts as follow

#### 1. First Base
First base is where i mount the motor used in this robot platform. Like i said before, i used 4 motors connected to omni-wheels. These motors are coupled with planetary gear mechanism to increase the torque provided by the motor.
#### 2. Second Base
#### 3. Upper Armor
