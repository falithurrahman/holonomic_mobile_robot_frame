#### Description
In this project i designed a platform for holonomic mobile robot with 4 omni-wheels. I used 3mm and 5 mm allumunium alloy as a material for this robot platform. Then i have these alloys cut with laser cutting machine. I divided the explanation for these platform into several parts as follow

#### 1. First Base
First base is where i mount the motor used in this robot platform. Like i said before, i used 4 motors connected to omni-wheels. These motors are coupled with planetary gear mechanism to increase the torque provided by the motor. You can see the motor placed on the first base with green color. First base is made of 5mm allumunium alloy cut with laser machine. I used 10mm allumunium drilled-rod to connect first base and second base. You can see first base 3D mode at picture below.

#### 2. Second Base
Second base is where i place the electronic part in this robot. I placed the motor driver and microcontroller at the second base. The battery used in this robot is also placed at the second base. The second base is made of 3mm allumunium alloy, also cut with laser cutting. The allumunium rod from first base is bolted to the second base. You can have the preview of first base and second base at the picture below.

#### 3. Third base
Third base is the top part of this robot platform. I place gyroscope and accelerometer sensor at this base. This base is also made of 3mm allumunium alloy and connected to second base with 8mm allumunium rod. This rod is bolted at the second base and third base. Below is the full preview of this mobile robot platform consisted of each base.

I designed this platform using Autodesk AutoCAD and Inventor for student. If you have any question, feel free to ask. Thanks.
